# Week Start Day Logic Implementation

## Current Date: June 30, 2025 (Monday)

## Implementation Logic

The week start day preference now works exactly as requested:

### Key Features:
1. **Week starts from chosen day**: The 7-day period begins from the user's selected start day
2. **Shows consecutive 7 days**: Always displays exactly 7 days starting from the chosen day
3. **Future days show "------"**: Days that haven't occurred yet display "------"
4. **Past days show actual data**: Days that have occurred show real spending data or "------" if no spending

## Examples:

### Default (Saturday Start)
**Today: Monday, June 30, 2025**
**Week starts: Saturday, June 28, 2025**

Day 1: Sat (June 28) [PAST - show data if exists]
Day 2: Sun (June 29) [PAST - show data if exists]  
Day 3: Mon (June 30) [TODAY - show data if exists]
Day 4: Tue (July 1) [FUTURE - show ------]
Day 5: Wed (July 2) [FUTURE - show ------]
Day 6: Thu (July 3) [FUTURE - show ------]
Day 7: Fri (July 4) [FUTURE - show ------]

### User Chooses Monday
**Today: Monday, June 30, 2025**
**Week starts: Monday, June 30, 2025**

Day 1: Mon (June 30) [TODAY - show data if exists]
Day 2: Tue (July 1) [FUTURE - show ------]
Day 3: Wed (July 2) [FUTURE - show ------]
Day 4: Thu (July 3) [FUTURE - show ------]
Day 5: Fri (July 4) [FUTURE - show ------]
Day 6: Sat (July 5) [FUTURE - show ------]
Day 7: Sun (July 6) [FUTURE - show ------]

### User Chooses Tuesday
**Today: Monday, June 30, 2025**
**Week starts: Tuesday, June 24, 2025**

Day 1: Tue (June 24) [PAST - show data if exists]
Day 2: Wed (June 25) [PAST - show data if exists]
Day 3: Thu (June 26) [PAST - show data if exists]
Day 4: Fri (June 27) [PAST - show data if exists]
Day 5: Sat (June 28) [PAST - show data if exists]
Day 6: Sun (June 29) [PAST - show data if exists]
Day 7: Mon (June 30) [TODAY - show data if exists]

## Technical Implementation:

### 1. Week Start Calculation (`getCurrentWeekStartDate`)
- Gets user's preferred start day from preferences
- Calculates how many days to go back to reach the most recent occurrence of that day
- Returns the calculated start date

### 2. Daily Display Logic (`updateWeeklyDailySpending`)
- Shows 7 consecutive days starting from the week start date
- Compares each day with today's date
- If day > today: shows "------" (future)
- If day <= today: shows actual spending data or "------" if no data

### 3. User Experience
- User sets preference in PreferenceActivity
- Analytics automatically calculates week based on preference
- Only shows actual data for days that have occurred
- Future days clearly marked with "------"

## Code Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced `calculateDaysToGoBack` method** with detailed logic explanation
2. **Updated `updateWeeklyDailySpending`** to handle future dates properly
3. **Added comprehensive debug methods** to test different scenarios
4. **Improved logging** to show exactly what's happening for each day

## Result:
The weekly analytics now perfectly reflects the user's preferred start day while intelligently handling future dates by showing "------" for days that haven't occurred yet.
