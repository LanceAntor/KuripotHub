# KuripotHub Firebase Setup

## ✅ Current Status: New Firebase Project Configured

Your app is now configured with a fresh Firebase project: `kuripothub-6172a`

## 🔥 Firebase Services Enabled

Make sure these services are enabled in your Firebase Console:

### 1. Authentication
- Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/kuripothub-6172a/authentication
- Enable **Email/Password** sign-in method

### 2. Firestore Database
- Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/kuripothub-6172a/firestore
- Create database in **test mode** for development
- Choose your preferred region

## 🛡️ Security Configuration

### Current Setup:
- ✅ `google-services.json` is properly excluded from git
- ✅ Fresh API keys are being used
- ✅ Old compromised keys are no longer in the repository

### File Structure:
```
app/
├── google-services.json          ← Your actual config (NOT in git)
└── google-services.json.template ← Reference template (safe for git)
```

## 🚀 Testing Your Setup

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

2. **Test authentication**:
   - Run the app
   - Try creating a new account in SignUpActivity
   - Verify login works in LoginActivity

3. **Test Firestore**:
   - Add an expense in the main screen
   - Check if data appears in Firebase Console → Firestore

## 🔧 App Features Ready:

- ✅ **User Authentication** (signup/login)
- ✅ **Expense Tracking** (add/view expenses)
- ✅ **Budget Management** (set/update budget)
- ✅ **Transaction History** (view past expenses)
- ✅ **Logout Functionality** (custom dialog)

## 📱 Testing Checklist:

1. **Loading Screen** → Shows app logo and transitions
2. **Login/Signup** → Firebase authentication working
3. **Main Expense Screen** → Add expenses, manage budget
4. **Settings Icon** → Logout dialog appears
5. **Transaction History** → Calendar view works

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

- **Never commit** `google-services.json` to version control
- **Test with real devices** for best Firebase performance  
- **Enable app restrictions** in Firebase Console for production

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### Build Errors:
- Ensure `google-services.json` is in `app/` directory
- Verify internet connection for Firebase
- Clean and rebuild: `./gradlew clean build`

### Authentication Issues:
- Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
- Verify email/password is enabled
- Check app package name matches: `com.example.kuripothub`

### Firestore Issues:
- Verify database is created and in test mode
- Check Firestore rules allow read/write
- Monitor Firebase Console for real-time data

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. Test all app features thoroughly
2. Set up Firestore security rules for production
3. Configure app signing for release builds
4. Consider adding more authentication methods (Google, etc.)
